We Cloned Medium Website.We was three members in my team. We used React,HTML,CSS for frontend .
Also we used material UI & Chahkra UI in some part of our frontend .
Also deployed JSON server for storing articles and Blog Data. We used Google OAuth for login & register.
This site is basically based on CRUD opertion ,user can create ,Read ,upadte & delete their blogs, so 
we also worked on this opertion ,except on update part .We will happy to work on update opertion in near future.
